To run the project, first install the needed packages through "pip install -r requirements.txt"
Then go to the __main__.py and run it with "python3 __main__.py".
If you desire, you can run only specific parts of the project by commenting out the unwanted ones.
Some labs require you to run previous ones, i.e: to run lab11/lab11_eval you have to run first lab5,8,9
